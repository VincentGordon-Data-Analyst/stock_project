# Project Overview

This project aims to analyse the stock price of some of the largest tech companies known by FAMAG – Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet. The reason we chose this topic is because we found the dataset to work with and we could explore to understand the economic scenario that the technology industries faced in the past few months where thousands of workers across the globe has been laid off from the technology sector.



# Data Source

## Questions to be answered

The main questions we tried to address with the dataset is: Did all stocks increase in price with COVID or just “tech”? a follow up question to this is Did all stock decrease in price recently or is it just “tech”?

# Results

Tech industries stock market had increased dramatically during covid, and decreased during the recent increase in mortgage rates. Although, so did many other sectors.

These Preliminary findings suggest that there specific tech recession, but an overall recession that affects most stocks. 



## Limitations related to the project

Correlation is not causation. Although these stocks are correlated with the rise of covid19 and interest rates, 
we would need more evidence to confirm if those factors are causative.


# Nex steps for future analysis

We would want to analyze the financial statments of these companies, and compare it against their industry.
Recession can also be measured by unemployement rate. We could of compared the unemployement rates between sectors.
